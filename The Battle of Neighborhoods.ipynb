Today, the city extends to an area of some 31.1 hectares. The largest expansion of the urban area is 20.7 kilometers from north to south and from east to west 26.9 km. The extent of the city limits is 119 km. Munich is divided into 25 administrative districts. The data in [this page](http://www.total-munich.com/20160623888/blog/moving-to-munich/moving-to-munich-introduction-to-munich-s-boroughs.html) shows all of the city\u2019s 25 districts, as well as their respective surface and population. The data also shows the percentage of foreigners living in each of the districts and the density of the population in each of them.",

Also analyze does this has any influence from **population density of foreigners**.\n\nPower of data science is used to generate a few most promissing districts based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.",
